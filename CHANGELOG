Version 0.2.1 ???, 2010.

  - Added support for configuration files in both client and server. Now
    default config files are installed and read when running "aldaba start" or
    "aldabad start". Also, custom config files may be supplied through the
    command line using the --config parameter.
  - Fixed a bug in verbosity level specification.

Version 0.2.0 Nov 15, 2010.

  - Aldaba has been completly rewritten in C++.
  - Full support for IPv6
  - Flexible covert channel field specification.
  - Improved crypto key generation.
  - Improved SPA protocol.
  - Added full protection against replay attacks.
  - Improved documentation.
  - Improved installation process.

Version 0.1.7 May 5, 2008.

  - Client and Server have been merged into a single source package. This should
    improve maintainability. No more copy & paste from one side to the other.
  - There has been a little adjustment in server's version number. This version
    should have been server's 0.1.5 but as from now on, client and server will  
    have the same version number, I've decided to "upgrade" the server to 0.1.7.
  - Added additional instalation modes to Makefile
  - Installation now makes a backup of configuration files and scripts before
    overwritting.
  - Little improvements in data wiping functions.
  - Updated Aldaba tutorial.
  - Fixed some errors in man pages.

| ALDABA SERVER CHANGELOG |
+-------------------------+

Version 0.1.4 Apr 29, 2008.

  - Fixed bug in file parser. Reported and fixed by Joshua Caster.
  - Added code to wipe sensitive data (encryption keys, etc) before exiting 
    the application or when the SIGINT signal is delivered.
  - Added code to test the correctness of crypto functions. Now, when the 
    program starts, ciphers and hash functions are tested against known 
    correct values. 

Version 0.1.3 Dec 24, 2007.

  - New checksum format. From now on, SPA packets will use SHA256 checksums as
    MD5 is not secure anymore. 
  - SPA "command" field has been reduced from 200 bytes to 184 due to the use of
    SHA256 checksums that take 16 bytes more than MD5.
  - Added support for new encryption algorithms. Now, the following ciphers can
    be used to encrypt/decrypt SPA packets:
        - Rijndael (AES contest winner)
        - Twofish  (AES contest third position)
        - Serpent  (AES contest second position)
        - Blowfish
    Note that IP-Id technique needs to use blowfish because it needs ciphers
    with a block size of 64bits or less.
  - Fixed typo in --help output


Version 0.1.2 Nov 19, 2007.

  - Added basic support for other data-link types than Ethernet. Currently
    supported data-link types are: 802.3, 802.11, PPPoE, Loopback and FDDI.
  - Fixed a possible buffer overflow while printing Ethernet headers.
  - Added support for new version of Aldaba SPA Protocol. Currently this
    protocol does the same as the previous one but it will support a lot of 
    interesting features in future releases. These include support for one time
    passwords, challenge/response authentication, timestamp based authentication
    remote command execution etc.
  - Source files were completely reorganized.
  - Minor bugfixes.
  

Version 0.1.1 Oct 11, 2007.

  - Some functions were moved to different source files. (Mainly because it 
    did not make much sense to be where they used to.
  - Output of --help changed. Now, instead of a big manpage a simple usage 
    message is displayed.
  - Added support for configuration files. A config file parser was written
    using a template created by tool GNU gengetopt.
  - Minor changes in the argument parsing process were made.
  - The "UDP technique" was renamed to "SPA technique". Many functions and 
    variable names were changed.
  - Added option "start" that forces configuration to be read from file
    /etc/aldabad/aldaba.conf
  - Changed argparser: Now case is ignored when parsing long arg names.
  - Minor change in the way encryption keys were being displayed in high
    verbosity modes. Now only first and last 2 bytes are displayed, enough to
    check for errors.

Version 0.1. Sep 30, 2007.

 - The way blowfish encryption keys were being used has changed. Now the
   encryption key is the MD5 hash of the user-supplied passphrase (salted with
   a 4-byte value). 
 - Added --debug switch. It sets maximum verbosity and disables daemon mode.
 - Added --quiet switch. It sets verbosity and logging levels to zero.
 - Argparser rewritten. Added support for longer arg names like --interface.


Version 0.1.beta2. Sep 21, 2007.

 - Fixed a bug in the parsing of the -t parameter. The number of supplied ports
   was not being checked. Now exactly 4 ports must be supplied for the IP-Id 
   technique and up to ten ports for the UDP technique.
 - Now when the parameter -t is supplied with only one port, the UDP technique
   is assumed automatically.
 - Changed Makefile. Now scripts are installed in mode 751 so regular users do
   not have permissions to read their contents.
 - Fixed a bug in the manpage and the --help output. Info about parameter -t
   was missing.
 - Fixed a bug in the execution of the open/close scripts. Added symbol "&" to 
   the system() call so scripts are executed in the background. Otherwise scripts
   could hung the server if they do not return immediatly.


Version 0.1.beta1. Sep 4, 2007.

 - Initial release.

| ALDABA CLIENT CHANGELOG |
+-------------------------+

Version 0.1.6 Apr 7, 2008.

  - Added code to wipe sensitive data (encryption keys, etc) before exiting 
    the application or when the SIGINT signal is delivered.
  - Added code to test the correctness of crypto functions. Now, when the 
    program starts, ciphers and hash functions are tested against known correct
    values.

    MD5 is not secure anymore. 
  - SPA "command" field has been reduced from 200 bytes to 184 due to the use of
    SHA256 checksums that take 16 bytes more than MD5.
  - Added support for new encryption algorithms. Now, the following ciphers can
    be used to encrypt/decrypt SPA packets:
        - Rijndael (AES contest winner)
        - Twofish  (AES contest third position)
        - Serpent  (AES contest second position)
        - Blowfish
    Note that IP-Id technique needs to use blowfish because it needs ciphers
    with a block size of 64bits or less.


Version 0.1.4 Nov 19, 2007.

  - Added option --dont-send. This option prevents Aldaba-client from actually
    sending any packet. It simulates it does but no information is sent to
    the network. Note that this option only disables Knock and SPA packets. 
    DNS lookups and HTTP requests for option --resolve-IP will still be sent.
  - Added support for new version of Aldaba SPA Protocol. Currently this
    protocol does the same as the previous one but it will support a lot of 
    interesting features in future releases. These include support for one time
    passwords, challenge/response authentication, timestamp based authentication
    remote command execution etc.
  - Source files were completely reorganized.
  - Minor bugfixes.

Version 0.1.3 Oct 31, 2007.


  - Fixed a bug in the parser for args --knock-IP and --source-IP. 
  - Added support for noise packets. This is, extra packets sent to prevent
    attackers with sniffing capabilities to guess the Knock sequence. A positive
    integer may be specified using the --noise param.
  - Changed the format IP-Id packets are displayed to stdout. Now they are 
    printed as rows of a table. Additional information is shown. 
  - Changed the way TCP/IP packets are crafted. Now there is a separate function
    to do it, including computing checksum.
  - Random number generator implemented. It is based on current pid, current
    uid, current time and 4 random bytes read from /dev/random. This should be 
    enough for a port knocking client.
  - Added support for decoys (additional IPs to send fake knocks from). This
    adds some obscurity to the knocking process. This feature can be combined
    with noise for extra effect.
  - Added support for an external IP resolver. Now, the internet-side IP address
    may be resolved using the service http://whatismyip.aldabaknocking.com.
    This is useful in NATed networks where the knocking information should not
    contain a local area network address but an external IP.


Version 0.1.2 Oct 11, 2007.

  - Some functions were moved to different source files. (Mainly because it 
    did not make much sense to be where they used to.
  - Output of --help changed. Now, instead of a big manpage a simple usage 
    message is displayed.
  - Added support for config files. Because of this, the argparser was rewritten 
    to use separate functions to process each type of argument.
    Config files can be specified using the --config="" parameter.
  - Minor change in the way encryption keys were being displayed in high
    verbosity modes. Now only first and last 2 bytes are displayed, enough to
    check for errors.

Version 0.1.1 Sep 30, 2007.

 - Fixed a bug in the computation of IP, TCP and UDP checksums.	
 - Now when the parameter -t is supplied with only one port, the UDP technique
   is assumed automatically.
 - Fixed a bug in the parsing of the -i parameter. Before, the user was being
   completely ignored and the interface "eth0" was being used in all cases.
 - Fixed a bug in the manpage and the --help output. Info about parameter -t
   was missing.
 - "Argparser rewritten. Added support for longer arg names like --source-IP.
 - The way blowfish encryption keys were being used has changed. Now the
   encryption key is the MD5 hash of the user-supplied passphrase (salted with
   a 4-byte value). 

Version 0.1 

 - Initial release.
