.SH "MODES OF OPERATION"
.PP
.PP
\fB\-\-spa\fR (Single Packet Authorization Mode)
.RS 4
This option tells Aldaba Client to run in SPA mode\&. Single Packet Authorization is the technique that allows users request access to a given port number on the server, using a single authentication message\&. That message, called the SPA authentication message, is transmitted to the server in a single UDP datagram\&. This technique provides strong authentication and is the default operation mode in Aldaba\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-pk\fR (Port Knocking Mode)
.RS 4
This option tells Aldaba Client to run in PK mode\&. Like SPA, Port Knocking lets users request access to a given port\&. However, the authentication message is transmitted stealthily, dividing it, and encoding each part in the headers of a TCP SYN packet\&. Port Knocking authentications are more difficult to detect from an attacker\'s point of view\&. However, the security provided by this technique is often weaker than in SPA\&.
.RE
.SH "SINGLE PACKET AUTHORIZATION"
.PP
.PP
\fB\-K \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR, \fB\-\-spa\-ip \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR (Set authorized address)
.RS 4
This option sets the authorized address\&. This is, the address that will be allowed access to the remote port upon successful authentication\&. The address can be specified as a standard IP address or as a hostname\&. Note that when no SPA address is specified, the Aldaba client will try to determine one\&. By default it picks the assigned IP address of one of the network interfaces present in the local system\&. If you are behind a NAT device, you\'ll need to set up the NAT\'s public IP address in order to access the knock port\&. Check option \-\-resolve for information on how to determine that address automatically\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR, \fB\-\-bind\-ip \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR (Set local address)
.RS 4
This option lets you specify an IP address to bind to for outgoing messages\&. Note that the supplied IP must be the address of one of the system\'s network interfaces\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR, \fB\-\-spa\-port \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR (Set authorized port)
.RS 4
Port number to open/close/forward in the remote system\&. Note that SPA mode let\'s you specify up to two ports\&. If you want to set more that one port, just pass this option twice, one for each\&. Supplied port number must be a positive integer in the range [1\-65635]\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR, \fB\-\-target\-port \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR (Set target port number)
.RS 4
This option specifies the destination port numbers for the UDP datagram that transports the SPA authentication message\&. Note that the same port number must be set in both client and server\&. If no port is supplied, Aldaba will pick one automatically, based on the supplied passphrase\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a \fR\fB\fIid\fR\fR, \fB\-\-action \fR\fB\fIid\fR\fR (Set desired action)
.RS 4
This option specifies the desired action to be executed by the server upon successful authentication\&. It must be one of "open", "close" or "forward"\&. Note that port forwarding requires two ports to be specified\&.
.RE
.SH "PORT KNOCKING"
.PP
.PP
\fB\-K \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR, \fB\-\-knock\-ip \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR (Set authorized address)
.RS 4
This option sets the authorized address\&. This is, the address that will be allowed access to the remote port upon successful authentication\&. The address can be specified as a standard IP address or as a hostname\&. Note that when no knock address is specified, Aldaba client will try to determine one\&. By default it picks the assigned IP address of one of the network interfaces present in the local system\&. If you are behind a NAT device, you\'ll need to set up the NAT\'s public IP address in order to access the knock port\&. Check option \-\-resolve for information on how to determine that address automatically\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR, \fB\-\-source\-ip \fR\fB\fIaddress\fR\fR (Set source address)
.RS 4
This option lets you specify the IP address that is used as the source address for every IP datagram that is sent\&. It can be specified as a standard IP address or as a hostname\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR, \fB\-\-knock\-port \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR (Set authorized port)
.RS 4
Port number to open/close in the remote system\&. This is the port that will be opened or closed on the target host\&. It must be a positive integer in the range [1\-65635]\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t \fR\fB\fIports\fR\fR, \fB\-\-target\-ports \fR\fB\fIports\fR\fR (Set knock sequence)
.RS 4
List of ports to knock on\&. These should be the same ports Aldaba Server is listening to\&. The list should be comma separated and have no spaces in it (eg: \-t 1337,2600,8086,6800)\&. Also, ports must be unique\&. The number of ports needed depends on the type of authentication and the header field that is used to create the covert channel\&. If you don\'t supply the correct number of ports Aldaba will tell you how many is expecting\&.
.sp
Note that this parameter is completely optional and may safely be omitted\&. When not supplied, the sequence of ports is generated automatically, deriving it from the supplied passphrase\&. A give passphrase will always produce the same port sequence, in both client and server\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a \fR\fB\fIid\fR\fR, \fB\-\-action \fR\fB\fIid\fR\fR (Set desired action)

\fB\-A \fR\fB\fItype\fR\fR, \fB\-\-auth \fR\fB\fItype\fR\fR (Set authentication strength)
.RS 4
This option specifies the strength and security of the authentication\&. Currently there are two different possibilities:
.PP
light (Default)
.RS 4
Light authentication provides basic, but fast and effective client authentication\&. It requires very few packets to be sent to the server, minimizing the risk of packet loss and providing a good response time\&. However, although the the security of this authentication may be enough for some cases, it can be broken by skilled attackers\&. Systems that require high levels of security should use the strong authentication discussed below\&.
.RE
.PP
strong
.RS 4
Strong authentication provides a much more secure and robust client authentication\&. It requires the transmission of a higher number of packets, which increases the risk of packet loss, but provides effective protection against replay attacks, and significantly reduces the risk of poisoning attacks\&. Systems that require high levels of security should use this type of authentication\&.

.RE
.SH "CRYPTOGRAPHY OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-P \fR\fB\fIstring\fR\fR, \fB\-\-passphase \fR\fB\fIstring\fR\fR (Set passphrase)
.RS 4
Passphrase to be used to generate the necessary cryptographic keys (one for message authentication and one for message encryption)\&. It must be at least 8 characters long and have a maximum of 256 characters\&. If it contains spaces, it should be enclosed in double quotes (e\&.g: \-k "Use this to encrypt it all")\&. Special characters should be escaped using a backslash\&. Passphrases longer than 256 characters are valid but will be truncated\&. Cryptographic keys are derived from this passphrase using the PBKDF2 algorithm\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cipher\fR (Set encryption algorithm)
.RS 4
Algorithm to be used to encrypt authentication data\&. Currently the following algorithms are supported:
.PP
Blowfish
.RS 4
Symmetric ; 64\-bit block size ; Very Fast\&.
.RE
.PP
Rijndael
.RS 4
Symmetric ; 128\-bit block size ; Fast ; AES Standard\&. (DEFAULT)
.RE
.PP
Serpent
.RS 4
Symmetric ; 128\-bit block size ; Medium ; AES Contest finalist (2nd position)
.RE
.PP
Twofish
.RS 4
Symmetric 128\-bit block size ; Fast ; AES Contest finalist (3rd position)
.RE
.sp
All algorithms use 256\-bit keys\&. Note that Port Knocking mode with Light authentication MUST it Blowfish because it requires a block size of 64 bits\&.
.RE
.SH "CONCEALMENT OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-n \fR\fB\fInumber\fR\fR, \fB\-\-noise \fR\fB\fInumber\fR\fR (Send noise packets)
.RS 4
This option lets you include noise packets along with the real authentication packets, adding a bit of obscurity to the process, what should make it more difficult for an attacker to the determine the knock sequence\&. This option can be used for both, PK and SPA\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d \fR\fB\fIaddr_list\fR\fR, \fB\-\-decoys \fR\fB\fIaddr_list\fR\fR (Use decoys)
.RS 4
This options lets you use decoy hosts to obscure the authentication\&. addr_list must be a comma\-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames\&. Note that this option can only be used in Port Knocking mode\&.
.RE
.SH "NETWORKING OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-resolve \fR (Resolve external IP address)
.RS 4
This option asks Aldaba to resolve the internet\-side IP address using the address resolution service at http://whatismyip\&.aldabaknocking\&.com\&. This can be useful in NATed networks where the authentication message must include the internet\-side IP address,not the local area network IP address\&. This is equivalent to using \-\-knock\-ip external_ip\&. WARNING: Note that the address resolution operation is performed through a simple HTTP GET query to the remote service\&. All information is sent in the clear, and there is no guarantee of the integrity or authenticity of the results\&. Therefore, using this option may let an attacker perform a man\-in\-the\-middle attack, which could result in the attacker\'s IP address being included in the authentication data\&. Systems that require high levels of security must not use this option\&.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-v\fR\fB[\fIlevel\fR]\fR, \fB\-\-verbose \fR\fB[\fIlevel\fR]\fR (Increase or set verbosity level)
.RS 4
Increases the verbosity level, causing Aldaba to print more information during its execution\&. There are 9 levels of verbosity (0 to 8)\&. Every instance of
\fB\-v\fR
increments the verbosity level by one (from its default value, level 4)\&. Every instance of option
\fB\-q\fR
decrements the verbosity level by one\&. Alternatively you can specify the level directly, as in
\fB\-v3\fR
or
\fB\-v\-1\fR\&. These are the available levels:
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR\fB[\fIlevel\fR]\fR, \fB\-\-reduce\-verbosity \fR\fB[\fIlevel\fR]\fR (Decrease verbosity level)
.RS 4
Decreases the verbosity level, causing Aldaba to print less information during its execution\&.
.RE
.SH "MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS"

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Please, report any bugs you find through the Aldaba development mailing list or directly to aldabaknocking@gmail\&.com\&. Please try to include as much information as possible\&. In general it\'s a good idea to include the output of the command "uname \-a", the version of Aldaba you are using and a brief description of the topology of the network you are using Aldaba from (subnets, routers, firewalls, etc)\&.
