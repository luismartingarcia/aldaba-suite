    |  After Installation |
    +---------------------+

    OPEN/CLOSE SCRIPTS

    Different systems have different firewall configurations so instead of
    manipulating firewall rules directly, Aldaba Server lets the user specify
    what should be done after correct authentications are received (open ports,
    start services, shutdown, delete files, run programs...)

    After installing Aldaba Server you should configure these scripts:

    /usr/local/etc/aldabad/scripts/aldaba_open.sh
    /usr/local/etc/aldabad/scripts/aldaba_close.sh
    /usr/local/etc/aldabad/scripts/aldaba_forward.sh
    /usr/local/etc/aldabad/scripts/aldaba_init.sh
    /usr/local/etc/aldabad/scripts/aldabada_cleanup.sh

    Those scripts are executed as a result of correct authentications.
    Please, check the content of each of those scripts for details.

    For more information check Aldaba Server man page (man aldabad).


+------------------------+
| 3. CODE DOCUMENTATION  |
+------------------------+

Aldaba's source code is commented using Doxygen markup tags. To generate the 
documentation install doxygen in your system and run "doxygen Doxyfile" from
directory aldaba-suite. Documentation will be generated in HTML format and will
be placed in directory "../aldaba-doc/doxygen-doc"
