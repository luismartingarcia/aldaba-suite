#  The syntax of this file is pretty simple: option="string"
#  Empty lines or lines that begin with # will be ignored.
#  Currently, the following options are supported:
#
#  ip-version, technique, hostname, port, passphrase, action, target-ports,
#  authorized-ip, resolve-ip, source-ip, verbosity, interface, noise, decoys
#  cipher, field.
# 
#  Check below for a brief description of each option. Note that unknown
#  option specifications will produce a simple warning message and then will be
#  ignored.
# 
#  Options "hostname" and "passphrase" need to be specified. The rest 
#  can be safely ommited. In that case, default values will be used. Check the 
#  man page for details.
#
#  Additional documentation may be found at http://www.aldabaknocking.com
#


# IP version number ["IPv4", "IPv6"]
ip-version="IPv4"

#  Technique to be used: Port Knocking or Single Packet Authorization. ["PK",
#  "SPA"]
technique="SPA"

#  Destination hostname or IP address. This is the address of the remote Aldaba
#  Server. It must be a valid IP address or a resolvable domain name.
hostname="localhost"

#  Port Number. Remote port to open or close. The remote server will receive
#  this value and it will pass it to the open/close scripts.
port="22"

#  Passphrase to be used for cryptographic key generation. It should be at least
#  8 characters long. Make sure this configuration file is note public readable
#  or the passphrase could be accessed by unauthorized users. If this option is
#  omitted (commented out), the passphrase will be asked interactively when
#  the client starts.
passphrase="Squeamish Ossifrage"

# Action to take. ["open", "close", "forward"]. The remote server will receive
# this value and execute the proper script (aldaba_open.sh, aldaba_close.sh or
# aldaba_forward.sh)
action="open"

#  Target ports. Normally there is no need to specify this as both Aldaba client
#  and server, derive a port sequence from the passphrase. However, if you need
#  to set up a fixed port sequence (or a single port number for SPA), you can
#  do it through this option. Ports must be specified as a comma-separated list
#  with no white spaces. Please check the man page for the exact number of
#  ports required by the each configuration.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#target-ports="1111,2222,3333,4444"

#  This is the IP address to be authorized on the remote server. Normally Aldaba
#  client figures this out by itself. However, if you are behind a NAT or you
#  want to authorize other IP than your current address, you may specify it
#  using this option. The address must be specified as a standard IP or as a
#  resolvable host name.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#authorized-ip="138.4.0.1"

#  This option lets yout resolve your internet-side IP address using the address
#  resolution service at http://whatismyip.aldabaknocking.com. This can be
#  useful in NATed networks where the authentication message must include the
#  public internet IP address,n ot the local area network IP address. Before
#  enabling this, please check the man page for details as using this option
#  has certain security risks.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#resolve-ip="yes"

#  This option lets you specify the IP address that is used as the source
#  address for every IP datagram that the client sends. Normally you don't
#  need to specify this. Use it when you want to use an spoofed address.
#  It can be specified as a standard IP address or as a hostname.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#source-ip="138.4.0.99"

#  Level of verbosity [0 - 8]
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#verbosity="5"

#  Network interface to be used as a hint for the source IP and Knock IP รง
#  determination. Use this only when Aldaba client is not guessing your
#  source IP right.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#interface="eth0"

#  Number of "Noise" packets
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#noise="250"

#  List of decoy systems.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#decoys=1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3

#  Encryption algorithm to be used for data encryption. Check man page for
#  a list of possible options.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#cipher="AES"

#  This option specifies the protocol header field to use to establish the
#  covert channel. This is only for the Port Knocking Technique. Please check
#  the man page for the available fields.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#field="tcp-seq"

#  This option specifies the strength and security of the Port Knocking
#  authentication. This is only for the Port Knocking Technique. Please check
#  the man page for details.
#  [Uncomment the following line to enable the option]
#auth="Strong"
