 This file contains Aldaba's to-do list. Items are listed in order of 
 priority (high priority items are listed first). Feel free to work on
 any of the items on the list. However, if you'd like to work on 
 something that is not trivial to implement you may want to send a 
 message to the aldaba-devel list before you start so other developers 
 can see what you are planning to do. Make sure you explain exactly what
 you are trying to fix/implement and how you are planning to do it. 
 It's always better to discuss bugfixes and new feature additions in
 advance because they may actually have bigger implications than you 
 think and you may not get your patch accepted.

 Please keep in mind that contributed code must:
  * Be written in C++.
  * Include comments so anyone can understand immediately what it does.
  * Work on Linux, Mac OS and MS Windows. It's OK if you have not tested
    the code in all those platforms, but at least keep portability in mind when
    you write it and include a list of systems you've tested it on along with
    your patch.

  Questions, comments and patches should be sent to the Aldaba development
  mailing list (aldaba-devel).

* URGENT: Improve random number seeding.
* write wireshark dissector for PK and SPA protos.
* Make sure things like -p3/udp -v9 -p4 --forward are not allowed by the client.
  Currently the server discards SPA packets where the two knock port don't have
  the same protocol, but it's output looks like it hanged.
